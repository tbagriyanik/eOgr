INSTALLATION:
-------------
(1) Edit your settings in "database.php" with an editor. 
    All values must be properly edited.
    For example, if you don't write your site URL into $_source1 value, the project may give errors.

(2) " http://localhost/eogr/install.php " is for installation. 

    If you didn't create your database previously, you have to click install.php for 2 times.
    First time to create your database, second time for table creation.

    Your MySQL user must have "CREATE TABLE" permission! 
    After a successful installation, you can remove/rename "installation_Database.sql" and install.php files.
	
    If you don't want to use install.php, you can import "installation_Database.sql" from phpmyadmin page.

(3) Login as administrator user: name "admin" and password "11111"
    I hope you start and like this fresh experience!
